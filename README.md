# twoSum

Date completed: 9/9/2020
The lab takes in an array and a target number and finds two different numbers that adds up to the target number.
Instead of the brute force method, this method uses two different pointers. One pointer at the beginning of the array and one at the end. 
After sorting the list, and calling the twoSum method, it will start checking whether the first and last numbers in the array adds up to the target number. If it does and it's not the same number, it will return the indexes in an array. The pointers will also move depending on whether the both number added is bigger or smaller than target number.
